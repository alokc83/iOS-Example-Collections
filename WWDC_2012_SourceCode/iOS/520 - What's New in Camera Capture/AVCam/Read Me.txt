Read Me About AVCam
========================
2.0

AVCam demonstrates usage of AV Foundation capture API for recording movies, taking still images, and switching cameras.

AVCam runs on iOS 6.0 and later.

Packing List
------------
The sample contains the following items:

o Read Me.txt -- This file
o AVCam.xcodeproj -- An Xcode project for the sample
o Classes.[h,m] -- The core AVCam code
o main.m -- Creates the app object and the application delegate and sets up the event cycle
o Resources -- Contains the application nib files and image files for the user interface

Building the Sample
-------------------
AVCam was built with Xcode 4.5 on Mac OS X 10.7.4 with the iOS 6.0 SDK. To build the app, simply open the project and choose Build from the Build menu. This project cannot be built for the iOS simulator.

Using the Sample
----------------
Use the buttons to perform video and still image capture:

   Record -- start/stop video recording
   Camera -- switch between front and back cameras
   Photo -- capture a still image

A single-tap will cause an auto focus at a specific point, then lock focus. A double-tap will change back to continuous auto focus.

Photos and movies will be saved to the device's camera roll. Note that on a device with no camera, but a mic, the app will record audio-only movies, which cannot be stored in the camera roll. They will instead be saved within the app bundle and made accessible through iTunes file sharing.

How It Works
------------

AVCam makes use of the following AV Foundation AVCapture classes to provide audio, video and still image capture and control:

AVCaptureConnection
AVCaptureDevice
AVCaptureFileOutput
AVCaptureInput
AVCaptureMovieFileOutput
AVCaptureOutput
AVCaptureSession
AVCaptureStillImageOutput
AVCaptureVideoPreviewLayer

See the AV Foundation documentation for more information.
